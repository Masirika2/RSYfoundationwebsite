        <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
        <p> 
            Uganda is home to about 2 million active registered refugees in June 2024__ “data.unhcr.org” 
            constituting over 70% of the youth population where 50% access primary school and due to a lack of significant support in the education journey, 
            20% manage to finish high school, and only 1% access higher education opportunity. 
            Additionally, due to the trauma and tough experiences, the community is hopeless, young girls drop out of school and get married at a very young age, 
            and young people are not open to opportunities that can help them break the cycle of poverty and develop a positive mindset to solve challenging problems in the settlement. 
            Therefore, there is a need for humanity to implement vocational skills and strong youth programs to integrate into these marginalized communities and schools working with CBOs 
            to help young refugees and internally displaced children foster their social cohesion, provide psychological support, 
            develop their talent to raise their voices out there in the world and achieve inclusion.
